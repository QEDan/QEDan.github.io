# How to Introduce New Technologies to Your Organization

Boss: Get back in the huddle. It's your turn to be on the outside.

You: Right away, boss. It sure is hard to work given how cold we are all the time. 

Boss: That's why it's so important to huddle. Get back to work.

You: A lot of our teammates are sick today because of food poisoning. That impacts productivity as well as the warmth of the huddle
which impacts productivity again!

Boss: Constant food poisoning is a fact of life. We can't ask people to come in sick.

You: I know, I know. Let's get back to talking about temperature. I noticed something about these sticks I brought with me today. 
Try rubbing them together really fast.

Boss: This is a waste of time. Get back to work.

You: They get really warm. Maybe that can help us work better!

Boss: These are barely warm. This doesn't make any difference to our huddle.

You: I know. I agree. But, hear me out. What if we rubbed them together really fast!

Boss: We don't have time for this.

You: I know. I'm sorry for wasting so much time. It's just that a lot of our competitors are making a lot of progress using 
heat from sticks, so I thought we could give this a try.

Boss: I've studied those hot stick products you're talking about, personally. I wrote a competitive intelligence report on them. 
Those hot sticks are not just regular sticks that were rubbed together. There's something totally different going on there.
Please go back to work.

You: I know, I know. Those hot sticks they have are really great, and there's no way we could do that here. We should focus on 
what we're good at. But, I read some of the papers that our competitors wrote about how they made the sticks so hot. I think
we could try the rubbing thing and just see if it works at all.

Boss: You've wasted enough time on this. If it gets you back to work faster, I'll try rubbing them myself and then you'll see 
it doesn't work. This isn't my first time rubbing sticks together, you know.

You: Great. Here you go.

Boss: See? They get warm, but that's it.

You: Wait, I also made this bow so that we can spin one of the sticks on its axis. That's kind of like rubbing really, really fast.
It's another thing I read about. I'm not sure if it will work, though.

Boss: This is getting tiresome. Hand me the bow and let's put an end to this.

You: Here you go!

Boss: It's smoking. Oh my God. It's hot! It's making light!

You: Wow, this outcome was totally unpredictable. You're a genious!

Boss: I know, I know. This isn't my first rodeo. But now, what do we do with this hot stick?

You: According to my studies, theoretically it could be spread to make more things hot. We can use it to keep our employees warm
so they can work harder, and use it to cook food so they stop getting food poisoning.

Boss: We can spread it? We should spread it onto the employees clothes so that they will be warm!

You: Uh...
