# What Else Should Data Scientists Learn?

Data Science is a complex job. Learning a lot of statistics and machine learning is obivously helpful, but failing to focus on other skills can leave you 
with weaknesses that will hinder your ability to work effectively. On the other hand, developing basic competencies in other skills can make you much more 
effective individually, and a joy to work with on a team. Besides statistics and machine learning, what are some other skills that data scientists should
practice regularly, and what are some good resources for learning how to practice? 


## Software Engineering
Data scientists often write code that is only used for a short period of time, and often where they are the only user. If the code becomes 
too complex and unweildy, it can easily be thrown out to start over because no one is relying on it. In this mode, you won't learn 
what it takes to write high quality software, as part of a large development team, so that the code is reliable, scalable, and changeable. 
Professional software engineers are thoughtful about managing the complexity of projects so that changes can be made quickly, safely, and 
locally. If you practice these skills, you'll be able to write better software with fewer bugs. It pays off even if you are the only user. 
Don't listen to people who say it's not worth the time; you'll move even faster writing good code than you did writing sloppy code.

## Scientific Record Keeping


## Technical Writing
It doesn't matter how great your ideas are if they aren't communicated clearly in writing. A verbal update in a meeting is no substitute. The 
meeting doesn't necessarily include everyone who will ever be interested in the idea, and realistically people can't understand new things 
all at once at the speed of conversation. Make sure everything you do gets documented in a report that is placed somewhere people will search for it.
These reports are invaluable to the organization, both as a record of what was done and for storing and retrieving institutional knowledge. They are 
also invaluable to future you who doesn't remember anything about a two-year-old project you worked on that suddenly becomes important once again.

## Project Management
Project management is a core life skill that everyone uses all the time. Making dinner, buying clothes, going on vacation, or maintaining a vehicle 
are all projects that require planning and executing multiple steps. But, not everyone is good at project management. Once there are a lot of steps, 
a lot of uncertainty, competition for resources and multiple people involved, managing a project requires a more professional skill set. 
There are many different approaches 
and frameworks for managing projects that have advantages and disadvantages in different scenarios. If you aspire to be a professional project manager
you should practice using lots of different frameworks. But, most people would benefit from choosing one and getting good with it. Use it at work, use it
at home, use it for vacation planning. Your new skills and tools will help you out in many aspects of your life. I recommend learning Kanban as a starting point
because of its relative simplicity and the emphasis on minimizing multitasking.

## Product Management
What is the long term vision for the product? Where is the product headed? Why is that the best direction? 
What do the customers need? What's the broad strategy for realizing the product vision?

These questions have incredible importance to the data science team.
