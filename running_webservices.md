# Guide to Running Your Own Webservices

## Why run your own webservices?

There are many reasons why you should run your own web services. For example:
* To learn skills and create something you are proud of
* Reduce your reliance and regain your freedom from big tech companies
* Be in control of your own computing tasks with free software
* Avoid trusting 3rd parties with privacy-sensitive data

## Overview

The basic steps are:
* Find a computer that has a reliable internet connection where you can install software
* Choose the services you'd like to run and install them
* Configure the services by setting up accounts, setting up databases, modifying configuration options, etc.
* Connect to your services from your personal devices
* Migrate your data from your existing services

This guide is intended to provide a general overview and some pointers to tools you will need and options to consider. It is not a step-by-step guide. You will have to read the documentation and learn how all the pieces work together. Otherwise, you are likely to run into problems that you'll be unable to solve yourself. That said, you don't need to be a computer expert to be successful. You can learn as you go, as long as you are willing to do some reading and spend some time debugging when there are problems.

## Finding a webserver

The first step is finding a computer to run your software. These options are listed from having the most control, to having the least control (but the most convenience):
* Purchase a computer and connect it to the internet using your ISP
* Purchase a computer and host it in a colocation center
* Rent access to a bare metal server in a datacenter
* Rent access to a virtual machine in a datacenter
* Use virtual machines from one of the large cloud providers
** Google Cloud
** Amazon AWS
** Microsoft Azure
