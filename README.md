## Open Source
* [Links Clustering](https://github.com/QEDan/links_clustering) - Python implementation of the [Links online clustering algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10123). Unlike most clustering algorithms, this one predicts cluster membership as it goes without needing to see the entire data set.
* [DLCheck](https://github.com/QEDan/DLCheck) - A tool for automatically discovering training problems in PyTorch Lightning Deep Learning models. Implements checks from [TFCheck](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02562) and [Deep Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04036).
* [hwc - The Hello World Compiler](https://github.com/QEDan/hwc) - A compiler that represents a novel approach to software development. The idea is for the compiler to take input source code written in any programming language and covert it into a working program with the desired features. This works even with new programming languages that do not have any existing compiler yet. Thus, it is useful for accelerating development of new programming languages, or for writing software using languages you don't understand.
* [Interstellar Mission Planning](https://github.com/QEDan/interstellar_mission_planning) - Some tools for planning interstellar missions
* Bug fixes and features
 * [Librosa - Deemphasis](https://github.com/librosa/librosa/pull/1293) - Implemented the [deemphasis effect](https://librosa.org/doc/0.10.1/generated/librosa.effects.deemphasis.html#librosa.effects.deemphasis) and added unit tests in a major audio library (6.5K stars).
 * [TSFresh - Index Preservation](https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh/pull/404) - Found and fixed a bug involving incorrect handling of indices and added unit tests in a major time-series library (8k stars).
