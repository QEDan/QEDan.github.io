# Before You Hire Data Scientists

Your organization wants to start doing data science (or machine learning, deep learning, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, etc.). Many organizations start by hiring a data scientist, or a team of data scientists with the intention of letting the data scientist(s) figure out the details. But this results in frustrated data scientists and poor outcomes for the data science projects. A good overview of the phenomenon is outlined in the article [Why so many Data Scientists are Leaving Their Jobs](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-so-many-data-scientists-are-leaving-their-jobs-a1f0329d7ea4), and the references cited by the article.

Full disclosure: This is from my perspective as a data scientist. I'm not an organizational leader.

## Things to Understand
### What is Data Science?
The term data science is often stretched to encompas many different types of work that involve data. Cutting through the hype, data science describes a type of work that is enabled by increasing availability (and falling prices) of computing hardware and the surprising revelations that 1) a huge number of business problems can be addressed by fitting curves to data and 2) more and better data can improve the solutions almost without limit. Traditionally, many of the problems that are solved by data science today were solved by a series of siloed teams passing pieces of solutions from an R&D team, to a prototyping team, to a software development team, to an operations team. Over the past 20 years, advancements have allowed small data science teams using agile and devops philosophies to research and deploy solutions at a small fraction of the time and cost of traditional approaches. Additionally, the range of problems that can be solved has increased, and often the quality of the solutions has also increased. I think this is the core of why there's so much hype around data science, big data, machine learning, artifical intelligence, etc.

The term data science is used to describe many different types of work. But, for the contents of this article, my focus is on organizations that are trying to leverage new ways of working that were impossible 20 years ago, rather than organizations trying to rebrand traditional approaches as "data science".

### Data Science is not (just) Software Development. It requires much more from the organization's side than traditional software.
It is (often) reasonable to equip a software developer with a laptop and some guidance from the product team and have her start building solutions from scratch on day one. In contrast, data science depends on having enough suitable data and in most cases, the data scientist will depend on the organization having already figured out a way to collect, store, and provide access to this data. The data can't be any data, but there has to be enough of it and it has to be suitable to the problem. The storage and access can't just be any storage and access, but it must be infrastructure that will allow the data scientist to remain focused on the problem at hand without being distracted by getting access, troubleshooting unrelated problems, etc.

### Data Science is higher-risk, higher-reward than traditional software



### Data Science projects require a very wide range of skillsets

Data science emphasizes a high level of automation and leverage of computing resources compared to traditional approaches to research. 

### The most successful data science products are the outcome of years of advanced planning


### Data Science projects have difficult politics
The above items add up to a very difficult scenario for traditional corporate politics to handle:
* Projects involve tight coordination between many different aspects of the organization (application developers, frontend developers, product teams, data engineers, sales, etc.)
* Projects require committing to a vision, possibly over several years, before there is a working solution
* There can be considerable risk around how successful the project will be, including the risk that the final solution is unsuitable for the problem it's supposed to solve and can't be used.


## Things to Do
### Planning

Your organization should do preparatory planning to identify what problems you want your data science team to address, as well as what resources they will need to address it. This planning should have the following objectives:
* Identify
