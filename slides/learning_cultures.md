## Active Learning Is Invisible

* Learning by testing conceptual mental models with tangible examples
* Goal is to scaffold understanding until confident you can contribute

## Code Reviews Don't Feel Safe

* Reputation threat
* Focus on "sounding like an engineer"
* Feels like being tested

## Lonely Environment

* Back to coding alone
* Minimal Support
* Hide your learning work

## Coding in the dark

“It’s like coding in the dark. Every once in a
while someone comes in to turn on the
lights and stare at you, like review, but then
you feel like you have to defend something.
But mostly I feel like I’m just sitting here
with all the lights off.”

## Learning Debt Cycle

* Involve people in defining "success"
* Encourage developmental feedback
* Make documentation and collaboration "count"
* Celebrate collaborative support
* Make the costs of learning debt visible

## Discussion Questions

Was the work celebrated?

## When have you felt safe/unsafe during a code review?

## When have you felt lonely or unsupported while working?
